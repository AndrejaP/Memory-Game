# Memory Game

This is a digital, one-player version of the game also known as Concentration, 
Match Match, Match Up, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs.
All of the cards are laid face down and two cards are clicked and flipped face up over each turn.
If they don't match they flip back. The object of the game is to find 8 pairs of matching cards 
in as few moves and as little time as possible.
